Steps I would need to take first and foremost:

1. Create the HTML, JS and CSS files and link them to the HTML through the external method
2. Using HTML and CSS, style out the layout for the calculator first and foremost BEFORE working on the JS.
3. The calculator must have the following functions:
                                            a. add
                                            b. subtract
                                            c. divide
                                            d. multiply
4. create a new function *operate()* that takes an operator and two numbers and calls one of the above functions

note:   do NOT use the eval() function!
        do NOT Use a solution where it ends up returning a new Function() that evaluates a string
